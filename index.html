      <h3> Ahh..... Your Eyes have a language of their own.<br/>
      If I could give you one thing in life,<br/>
      I could give you the ability to see yourself through my eyes,<br/>
      Only then you would realize how special you are to me.<br/>
      It's been almost 9 years i have been travelling with you.<br/>
      In these many years, we fought each other, we laughed together, cried together.<br/>
      Never stopped loving, even if we went though many tough situations.<br/>
      you were their for me in every situation, stood by me, never looked for a way to out, even if you have a way.<br/>

      Whatever happened in our lives, I don't wanna lose you, You are the one for me.<br/>
      Without you am nothing. <br/>

      You Know every phase of our lives, no need to say anything deep. cause you know again.<br/>

      Looking forward to be with you, want to make a family with you. ...... HAPPY US..........<br/>
